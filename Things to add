List of things I'd like to add.

1 - MarcXML Record import. 

2 - Statistics page.
  Unsure what statistics will be measured but it may be fun to experiment with

3 - Improved error handling
  Try/Catch statements are a good start but more will need to be done.
  
4 - UI improvements
  Too many to list
  - Clean up buttons on search pane
  - Adjust layout and notifications on AddBookController
  - etc etc
