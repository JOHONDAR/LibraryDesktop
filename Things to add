List of things I'd like to add.

1 - MarcXML Record import. 

2 - Statistics page.
  Unsure what statistics will be measured but it may be fun to experiment with

3 - Improved error handling
  Try/Catch statements are a good start but more will need to be done.
  
4 - UI improvements
  Too many to list
  ~~~- Clean up buttons on search pane~~~
  - Adjust layout and notifications on AddBookController
  ~~~- Add optiional middle name section for authors~~~
  - etc etc

~~~5 - Delete button for search page~~~
  ~~~Simple button for deleting selected books from the database.~~~
  **Completed**
  
~~~6 - Apostraphes in titles~~
  ~~Currently, adding titles with aposraphes retuurns errors. Add the ability to include apostraphes.~~
  **Completed**
