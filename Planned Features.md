List of things I'd like to add.

== Very Important! ==
=====================
This entire program is in need of a full architectural re-work. This will happen before any other additions are made.
Current priority is on the website though research is being done into how to properly structure this application.
=====================

1 - MarcXML Record import. 

2 - Statistics page.
  Unsure what statistics will be measured but it may be fun to experiment with

3 - Improved error handling
  Try/Catch statements are a good start but more will need to be done.
  
4 - UI improvements
  Too many to list
  - ~~Clean up buttons on search pane~~
  - Adjust layout and notifications on AddBookController
  - ~~Add optiional middle name section for obvListAuthors~~
  - etc etc

~~5 - Delete button for search page~~
  - ~~Simple button for deleting selected books from the database.~~
  **Completed**
  
~~6 - Apostraphes in titles~~
  - ~~Currently, adding titles with aposraphes retuurns errors. Add the ability to include apostraphes.~~
  **Completed**

  ~~7 - Details Page Functionality
  	- Add the ability to edit the information for existing books.
  		- Much additional work needed for this to work.~~
  	- Functional 'close' button.
  
  8 - User account sign-in
  	- Having to access the program through a sign-in process would improve security and 	prevent tampering with the database contents.
