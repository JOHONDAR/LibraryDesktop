##== Very Important! ==  
##This entire program is in the middle of a full architectural re-work many of these new features are being added and others are bing altered if not discarded.  

------------------

###Below is a list of the new features and other changes I would like to see done in the future.  

1 - MarcXML Record ~~import~~ export.  
    Note: Changed idea to an export function. The immense variety of data fields on a marcXML record (assuming one exists for a book) make an automated import function impractical and would likely not improve the user experience to any meaningful degree. An export option though, would be very beneficial and this is the course that will be looked into more.

2 - ~~Statistics page.~~ Feature removed.  
~~Unsure what statistics will be measured but it may be fun to experiment with~~  
There is too little meaningful information to be presented in such a hypothetical page that creating one would be, at best, a waste of time.

3 - ~~Improved error handling~~  
  - ~~Try/Catch statements are a good start but more will need to be done.~~  
**Completed**
  
4 - UI improvements
  Too many to list
  - ~~Clean up buttons on search pane~~
  - ~~Adjust layout and notifications on AddBookController~~
  - ~~Add optiional middle name section for obvListAuthors~~
  - etc etc

5 - ~~Delete button for search page~~
  - ~~Simple button for deleting selected books from the database.~~
  **Completed**
  
6 - ~~Apostraphes in titles~~
  - ~~Currently, adding titles with aposraphes retuurns errors. Add the ability to include apostraphes.~~
  **Completed**

  7 - ~~Details Page Functionality.~~  
  	- ~~Add the ability to edit the information for existing books.~~  
  		- ~~Much additional work needed for this to work.~~  
  	- ~~Functional 'close' button.~~  
    **Completed**
  
  8 - User account sign-in  
  	- Having to access the program through a sign-in process would improve security and 	prevent tampering with the database contents.
