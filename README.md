# LibraryDesktop

##Overview:

  This program's primary purpose is to streamline the process of adding books to a relational database of books that I may happen to own. 
  The end goal is to make the process of maintaining a complete record of my personal collection much easier than it currently is with minimal interaction with the database. 
 

### Recent Updates
  This application is currently in the midst of a major update. Nearly every class has been altered significantly and the UI is currently being re-worked to be more functional and better fulfil the needs of the creator and other potential user.

The program is currently in a feature complete state* though other ideas are being considered for implementation as well.

*By this, the author means that the program currently meets the pre-established goals that were in mind when intial work began. More features are in mind but most work on the application form now on will be bug fixes.
