# LibraryDesktop

Overview:

  This program's primary purpose is to streamline the process of adding books to a relational database of books that i happen to own. 
  The end goal is to make the process of mainting a complete record of my personal collection much easier than it currently is. 
  
  The program is currently in a beta state and doesn't have the statistics page available just yet. The rest of the code works and is stable.
